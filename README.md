# Discord Bot

A Discord bot built with Python using the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library. It responds to commands, 
sends random memes, and welcomes new members to the server.

This project is based on one of the guided project on Codedex: https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-discord-bot-with-python
The features will be further extended.
